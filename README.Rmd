## Summary

In this project, pet dogs voluntarily participated in a two-alternative object choice task with ostensive and non-ostensive experimental conditions, along with warm-up (one cup, two cup) trials and an odor control condition. We collected data from 20 sites in eight countries. The data file (`manydogs_etal_2024_data.csv`) contains records from 704 dogs tested for the main experiment between 2022-01-20 and 2023-01-23. Each row represents data for an individual dog.
